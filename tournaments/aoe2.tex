\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament.

\section{Game Version}
The Age of Empires \rom{2} tournament uses Age of Empires \rom{2}: Forgotten Empires (short ``AoFE''). This is the last game version that does not depend on additional external software and can be played in-LAN, while having support for newer windows versions. We will \textbf{not} use the HD version or Steam version.

\section{Setup}
Only use the game version provided by us to avoid version mismatch problems. There will be a step-by-step manual to set up the game and resolve common problems if it doesn't work out of the box.

Please go through the manual and test a multiplayer match hosting and non-hosting with other people in the LAN \textbf{before} the tournament starts. The tournament admin might be able to help you with problems.

If you are unsure about whether your hardware and operating system combo allows you to play AoFE, drop by at our office before the lanparty starts, so we can test it and resolve problems. Remember to re-check your firewall settings etc. when you arrive at the lanparty.

\section{Procedure}
\subsection{Hosting}
The team named first in the pairing hosts the game.
\subsection{Result}
The losing team announces the result to the tournament admin, also stating whether they ran into time limit.
\subsection{Map}
The map for each game is announced at the beginning of the group phase and at the beginning of each playoff round by the tournament admin.

\section{Settings}
\subsection{Map pool}
Maps chosen to be not water-divided, no special modus (lack of single resource or town center) and not too difficult for mediocre players. This essentially tries to reduce the number of matches which run into time limit and make the tournament fun for all participants.
\begin{itemize}
\item Arabia
\item Black Forest
\item Fortress
\item Highland
\item Mongolia
\item Yucatan
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Player settings}
All players must chose a different color. Civilization random, unless both teams agree to pick. Tournament admin can still force random if civ picking takes too long (eg. frequent adjustment to enemy civ combo by both teams).

\subsection{Game Settings}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Game Type: Random map
\item Size: normal
\item Difficulty: Normal
\item Ressources: Standard
\item Population limit: 200
\item Reveal Map: Explored
\item Game speed: Normal
\item Starting Age: Standard
\item Victory: timelimit â€“ 1500 years (2:00h)
\item Team together: yes
\item Lock Teams: yes
\item All Techs: no
\item Lock speed: yes
\item Allow cheats: no
\item Record Game: yes
\end{itemize}

Note that Victory setting of \textit{timelimit} does not allow winning by Wonder or Relic. Also note that using Speed setting \textit{Fast} would reduce the maximum available time limit setting of 2 hours to an effective 50 minutes, which is not acceptable. That's the reason for Speed setting \textit{Normal}.

\newpage

\section{Format}
The tournament will consist of a group phase and playoff phase. Modus will be 2v2, which means a team consists of two participants.

\subsection{Group Phase}
We will form groups depending on the number of total participating teams. The group phase of the different groups might not be parallel but during different time slots, to accomodate participation in other tournaments.

\subsection{Playoffs}
The best two teams of each group move on to the playoff phase.


\section{General rules}
\begin{itemize}
\item No cheating of any kind.
\item No spamming the chat (or taunts) during the game.
\item Pausing the game only if necessary. State the reason with ingame-chat and inform the tournament administrator immediately. Only the player who paused the game may unpause it and only after both teams are ready again - should the opponent team unpause a game it counts as their immediate loss of the game. However, do not hesistate to pause the game if there is any problem.
\item If there is any problem occuring early (unbearable lag, broken game, wrong settings, etc.), immediately pause the game and re-create a new one after resolving the problem. Do not wait until enemy contact.
\item It is assumed that you tested the game on your PC and have played a working multiplayer testgame (at least 3 minutes) both hosting and non-hosting with a real player in our LAN.
\item During group phase, give clearly weaker teams a chance to enjoy the game and avoid unfair tactics or taunting game actions. You can win without them.
\item During group phase, forfeit instead of stretching the game if you have no real chance of winning anymore.
\item Play nice.
\end{itemize}
