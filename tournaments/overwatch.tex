\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament.

\section{Match format}
The tournament uses the \textbf{default competitive rule set} (or something very close to it) of Overwatch where the same hero can be picked only once per team and without a role selection limit. Furthermore are all heroes allowed \textbf{except Brigitte} and the players are allowed to switch heroes during the match.

\section{Matches}
\subsection{Mapveto}
For choosing the map, each team will ban \textbf{one map per turn} until only one map is left. That map will then be played.
You can try \url{http://owdraft.com} for doing the mapveto but it does not always seem to be up-to-date with new maps
or you can do them face to face or ingame in the chat. At the LAN, we may also provide you with additional tools
for deciding which map to play. \\
The team which begins with banning should be picked at random.

\subsection{Server}
The lobbies for the games will be created by one of the teams. The exact settings for the lobbies will be provided at the LAN Party but they will be close to the default competitive settings.

\subsection{Pause}
The player who created the lobby will be able to pause the game. If there are any technical problems, it has to be written in the chat and the player who created the lobby has to pause the game. It is not allowed to pause the game for tactical reasons. In case of controversy, please contact an admin.

\section{Map pool}
All maps from the following categories are allowed: Assault, Escort, Assault Escort and Control.
Arena maps \textbf{will not be played} at this tournament.
