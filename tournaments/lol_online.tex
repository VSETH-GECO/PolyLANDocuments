\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament. This is a main tournament.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Account}
You have to own an account on the EUW server to compete in the tournament.
\\
Your account must not be excluded from normal or ranked play. If you're excluded from playing in normal or ranked games for any reason, you may not participate in the tournament.
\\
We do not require your account to be level 30 or higher, but we encourage you to use your main account if you own several accounts.

\subsection{Champions}
To compete in the tournament, you must own at least 20 champions. Champions that are in the Free-to-play rotation do not count!


\section{Teams}
A team consists of 5 players. One of the players has to be the designated team-captain.
\\
The team-captain is responsible for respecting the timetable of the tournament, for communication with the other team and for communication with the admin team.

\section{Game}
\subsection{Server}
All games have to be played on EUW. Games played on any other server, including the PBE, are void and the results will not be counted in the tournament.

\subsection{Gamemode}
All games have to be played in the gamemode \textbf{Tournament Draft}. The team on top of the match on the match bracket gets to be team 1 and therefore having first pick. 
\\
As we are using the \textit{Tournament Code Feature} of League of Legends, the matchmode will be set automatically.
\subsection{Map}
All matches have to be played on the map \textbf{Summoners Rift}.

\subsection{Tournament Code}
The \textit{Tournament Code Feature} enables an easy and convenient tournament. You'll find the Tournament Code on the toornament-page, on the game page. 
\\
All games have to be played with the tournament code. Exceptions from this rule may be made if there are technical problems, but these have to be announced to the tournament organizer, which then decides if the matches may be created manually.



\section{Bugs}
To hinder bug abuse the tournament organizer may disallow the use of:\\
Skins, champions, items or other game mechanic.

\section{Pause}
If you're having problems during the match, you can use the pause function of the game. The pause function may not be used during teamfights or to discuss the strategy for the game, you're only allowed to pause in case anyone in the match has technical difficulties.
\\
If you suspect anyone paused the game to get an advantage out of it, please contact an admin immediately.
