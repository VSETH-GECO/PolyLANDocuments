\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Account}
You have to own an account on the EUW server to compete in the tournament. You may transfer your account from another server to EUW to compete on your own expense.
\\
Your account must not be excluded from normal or ranked play. If you're excluded from playing in normal or ranked games for any reason, you may not participate in the game.
\\
We do not require your account to be level 30 or higher, but we encourage you to use your main account if you own several accounts.

\subsection{Champions}
To compete in the tournament, you must own at least 20 champions on your account. Champions that are in the Free-to-play rotation but not on your account otherwise do not count!


\section{Teams}
A team consists of 5 players. One of the players has to be the designated team-captain.
\\
The team-captain is responsable for respecting the timetable of the tournament, for communication with the other team and for communication with the admin team.
\\
If your team requires a substitute player, please read the section about substitute players below.

\section{Game}
\subsection{Server}
All games have to be played on EUW. Games played on any other server, including the PBE, are void and the results will not be counted in the tournament.

\subsection{Gamemode}
All games have to be played in the gamemode \textbf{Tournament Draft}. The team on top of the match on the match bracket gets to be team 1 and therefore having first pick. 
\\
The teamcaptain of team 1 creates a custom game and chooses \textbf{Tournament Draft} as game type and \textbf{Summoners Rift} as the map.
\\
The teamcaptain of team 1 then invites the teamcaptain of team 2 to the custom game. Both teamcaptains then invite their team and when both teams are ready, the teamcaptain of team 1 starts the match.
\subsection{Map}
All matches have to be played on the map \textbf{Summoners Rift}.

\section{Fair Play}
Cheating, flaming and other bad behaviour is strictly forbidden. While playing, teams have to follow the Summoners Code created by Riot Games.
\\
Violations of these rules can be punished by an admin.

\section{Roles}
\subsection{Teamcaptain}
The teamcaptain is the responsable for the whole team. He's in charge for communicating with other teams and the admin team.
\\
The teamcaptain is the owner of the team, as indicated in the team manager on the website. 
\\
The teamcaptain can be swapped before the tournament. After the tournament started, the teamcaptain may only be changed after asking an admin.
\\
After a game is over, the teamcaptain of the \textbf{losing team} has to announce the result to the tournament organizer.

\subsection{Player}
A player is part of a team (including the teamcaptain). All players have to follow the Summoners code and follow the instructions of the admin team.

\subsection{Substitute}
A substitute is a player which is not entered in the teammanager and does only play if another player from the team can't play for any reason.
\\
If your team requires a substitute player, you have to announce that to the tournament organizer \textbf{before} the tournament starts. The substitute is only allowed to play when it's not possible to play with the 5 normal players. It is not allowed to have the substitute play when all other players are present.
\\
The substitute player needs to have a rank which is equal or lower than the rank of the player being substitutet, e.g. it's not allowed to substitute a bronze player with a challenger player.
\\
In special cases (e.g. sudden illness of a player, technical difficulties etc.) the tournament organizes may allow a team to have a substitute that wasn't announced before the tournament start.

\subsection{Admin}
Admins are part of the GECo managing board or specifically designated GECo members. They can settle disputes and help with technical difficulties.

\subsection{Tournament organizer}
The tournament organizer is one designated member of the GECo managing board. He updates the scores and is the final instance when a dispute neeeds to be settled.
\\
The decisions of the tournament organizer are final and have precedence over any other rules.
\\
In case of a dispute, please do not hesitate to contact the tournament organizer directly.
\\
The tournament organizer is also an admin.

\section{Bugs and other problems}
In case of gamebreaking bugs the tournament organizer may issue the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skin not allowed in the tournament
	\item Champion not allowed in the tournament
	\item Item not allowed in the tournament
	\item Any other in game mechanic may also be forbidden if the bug produces an unfair advantage for any of the teams.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pause}
If you're having problems during the match, you can use the pause function of the game. The pause function may not be used during teamfights or to discuss the strategy for the game, you're only allowed in case anyone in the match has technical difficulties.
\\
If you suspect anyone paused the game to get an advantage out of it, please contact an admin immediately.

\section{Timetable}
Matches have to be played in the appropriate timeslots. We have set times where it's absolutely necessary to be present to play in the tournament. If a team is not able to play due to players missing, the match will be forfaited after a waiting time of 15 minutes after the scheduled match start.

\section{Punishments}
Violating the fair play rules or not respecting the decision of an admin or the tournament organizer may result in punishment.
\\
Depending on the gravity of the violation, the following punishments can be issued by an admin:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Warning
	\item Remake of a match
	\item Player being excluded from a tournament (in that case it's the teamcaptains responsability to find a substitute.)
	\item Match lost by forfeit
	\item Team being excluded from the League of Legends tournament
	\item Team being excluded from all tournaments (in this case, every player of the punished team may not compete in any other tournament and team)
	\item Player excluded from the event
	\item Team excluded from the event
\end{itemize}
Because we want the event to be a fun experience for everyone, we don't want to have to use the punishments, so please play fair, play nice, and have fun!
\\
If it's possible, always try to settle disputes directly in a nice manner.
