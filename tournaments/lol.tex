\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament. This is a main tournament.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Account}
You have to own an account on the EUW server to compete in the tournament. You may transfer your account from another server to EUW to compete. This is done at your own expense.
\\
Your account must not be excluded from normal or ranked play. If you're excluded from playing in normal or ranked games for any reason, you may not participate in this tournament.
\\
We do not require your account to be level 30 or higher, but we encourage you to use your main account if you own several accounts.

\subsection{Champions}
To compete in the tournament, you must own at least 20 champions on your account. Champions that are in the Free-to-play rotation but not on your account otherwise do not count!


\section{Teams}
A team consists of 5 players. One of the players has to be the designated team-captain.
\\
The team-captain is responsible for respecting the timetable of the tournament, for communication with the other team and for communication with the admin team.

\section{Game}
\subsection{Server}
All games have to be played on EUW. Games played on any other server, including the PBE, are void and the results will not be counted in the tournament.

\subsection{Gamemode}
All games have to be played in the gamemode \textbf{Tournament Draft}. The team on top of the match on the match bracket gets to be team 1 and therefore having first pick. 
\\
As we are using the \textit{Tournament Code Feature} from League of Legends, the matchmode will be set automatically.
\subsection{Map}
All matches have to be played on \textbf{Summoners Rift}.

\subsection{Tournament Code}
The \textit{Tournament Code Feature} enables an easy and convenient tournament. You'll find the Tournament Code in the teammanager, right next to the next games you'll have to play. 
\\
All games have to be played with the tournament code. Exceptions from this rule may be made if there are technical problems, but these have to be announced to the tournament organizer, which then decides if the matches may be created manually.

\section{Fair Play}
Cheating, flaming and other bad behaviour is strictly forbidden. While playing, teams have to follow the Summoners Code created by Riot Games.
\\
Violations of these rules can be punished by an admin.

\section{Roles}
\subsection{Teamcaptain}
The teamcaptain is the responsible for the whole team. They're in charge for communicating with other teams and the admin team.
\\
The teamcaptain is the owner of the team, as indicated in the team manager on the website. 
\\
The teamcaptain can be swapped before the tournament. After the tournament started, the teamcaptain may only be changed with admin permission.

\subsection{Player}
A player is part of a team (including the teamcaptain). All players have to follow the Summoners code and follow the instructions of the admin team.

\subsection{Substitute}
In special cases (e.g. sudden illness of a player, technical difficulties etc.) the tournament organizes may allow a team to have a substitute.
\\
\\
If a team may have a substitute player is decided by the admins on a per-case-basis.
\\
\\
Please note that all players of the team need to be present during the whole tournament. Work, other events, etc are not valid reasons for a substitute player and will result in losing matches that cannot be played due to that.
\\
\\
The substitute player needs to have a rank which is equal or lower than the rank of the player being substitutet, e.g. it's not allowed to substitute a bronze player with a challenger player.

\subsection{Admin}
Admins are part of the GECo managing board or specifically designated GECo members. They can settle disputes and help with technical difficulties.

\subsection{Tournament organizer}
The tournament organizer are two designated members of the GECo managing board. They update the scores and are the final instance when a dispute neeeds to be settled.
\\
The decisions of the tournament organizers are final and have precedence over any other rules.
\\
In case of a dispute, please do not hesitate to contact the tournament organizers directly.
\\
The tournament organizers are also admins.

\section{Bugs and other problems}
In case of gamebreaking bugs the tournament organizer may issue the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skin not allowed in the tournament
	\item Champion not allowed in the tournament
	\item Item not allowed in the tournament
	\item Any other in game mechanic may also be forbidden if the bug produces an unfair advantage for any of the teams.
	\item Very recently released champions not allowed in the tournament
\end{itemize}

\section{Pause}
If you're having problems during the match, you can use the pause function of the game. The pause function may not be used during fights or to discuss the strategy for the game. You're only allowed to use it in case anyone in the match has technical difficulties.
\\
If you suspect anyone paused the game to get an advantage out of it, please contact an admin immediately.

\section{Timetable}
Matches have to be played in the appropriate timeslots. We have set times where it's absolutely necessary to be present to play in the tournament. If a team is not able to play due to players missing, the match will be forfaited after a waiting time of 15 minutes after the scheduled match start.

\section{Punishments}
Violating the fair play rules or not respecting the decision of an admin or the tournament organizer may result in punishment.
\\
Depending on the gravity of the violation, the following punishments can be issued by an admin:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Warning
	\item Remake of a match
	\item Player being excluded from a tournament (in that case it's the teamcaptains responsability to find a substitute.)
	\item Match lost by forfeit
	\item Team being excluded from the League of Legends tournament
	\item Team being excluded from all tournaments (in this case, every player of the punished team may not compete in any other tournament and team)
	\item Player excluded from the event
	\item Team excluded from the event
\end{itemize}
Because we want the event to be a fun experience for everyone, we don't want to have to use the punishments, so please play fair, play nice, and have fun!
\\
If it's possible, always try to settle disputes directly in a nice manner.
