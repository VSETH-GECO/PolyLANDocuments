\section{General Tournament Rules}
Read the general tournament rules of the current event.\\
All the general rules apply to this tournament.

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Account}
You have to own an account on the EUW server to compete in the tournament. You may transfer your account from another server to EUW to compete on your own expense.
\\
Your account must not be excluded from normal or ranked play. If you're excluded from playing in normal or ranked games for any reason, you may not participate in the game.
\\
We do not require your account to be level 30 or higher, but we encourage you to use your main account if you own several accounts.

\subsection{Champions}
To compete in the tournament, you must own at least 20 champions on your account. Champions that are in the Free-to-play rotation but not on your account otherwise do not count!


\section{Teams}
A team consists of 5 players. One of the players has to be the designated team-captain.
\\
The team-captain is responsable for respecting the timetable of the tournament, for communication with the other team and for communication with the admin team.

\section{Game}
\subsection{Server}
All games have to be played on EUW. Games played on any other server, including the PBE, are void and the results will not be counted in the tournament.

\subsection{Gamemode}
All games have to be played in the gamemode \textbf{Blind Pick}.
\\
We are playing \textbf{Ultimate Bravery}. This means each player visits https://ultimate-bravery.net and rolls for a random champion and a random build.
\\
\\
Each player can roll \textbf{3 times} and choose the build they prefer. Please keep the browser with the build open during the match, so that if there are any disputes, we can check the build you got.
\\
\\
You get the following in Ultimate Bravery:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{Champion} that you have to pick. Please make sure to de-select any champions you do not have in the start screen of the Ultimate bravery website.
    \item A \textbf{skill} that you have to max. Every time you can level up a skill, you'll have to put a point into that skill. You may only level up the other skills when it's not possible to level up that skill.
    \item Two \textbf{Summoner Spells} that you HAVE to pick (even if it means that your team has 5 smites).
    \item A \textbf{Rune build} that you need to copy.
    \item An \textbf{item build} that you have to follow. You have to follow the build from left to right, and you may only build the next item when you finished your other item. You may not buy any other items, except HP potions and wards.
\end{itemize}

\noindent If you get the \textbf{magical footwear} rune, you may start building your second item until you can complete your boots.
\\
\\
\noindent To make it easier to follow the build, you can use the \textbf{Item set} button on the website to save your build as an item set in LoL.
\subsection{Map}
All matches have to be played on the map \textbf{Summoners Rift}.

\section{Fair Play}
Cheating, flaming and other bad behaviour is strictly forbidden. While playing, teams have to follow the Summoners Code created by Riot Games.
\\
Violations of these rules can be punished by an admin.

\section{Roles}
\subsection{Teamcaptain}
The teamcaptain is the responsible for the whole team. He's in charge for communicating with other teams and the admin team.
\\
The teamcaptain is the owner of the team, as indicated in the team manager on the website. 
\\
The teamcaptain can be swapped before the tournament. After the tournament started, the teamcaptain may only be changed after asking an admin.

\subsection{Player}
A player is part of a team (including the teamcaptain). All players have to follow the Summoners code and follow the instructions of the admin team.

\subsection{Substitute}
In special cases (e.g. sudden illness of a player, technical difficulties etc.) the tournament organizes may allow a team to have a substitute.
\\
\\
If a team may have a substitute player is decided by the admins on a per-case-basis.
\\
\\
Please note that all players of the team need to be present during the whole tournament. Work, other events, etc are not valid reasons for a substitute player and will result in losing matches that cannot be played due to that.
\\
\\
The substitute player needs to have a rank which is equal or lower than the rank of the player being substitutet, e.g. it's not allowed to substitute a bronze player with a challenger player.

\subsection{Admin}
Admins are part of the GECo managing board or specifically designated GECo members. They can settle disputes and help with technical difficulties.

\subsection{Tournament organizer}
The tournament organizer is one designated member of the GECo managing board. He updates the scores and is the final instance when a dispute neeeds to be settled.
\\
The decisions of the tournament organizer are final and have precedence over any other rules.
\\
In case of a dispute, please do not hesitate to contact the tournament organizer directly.
\\
The tournament organizer is also an admin.

\section{Bugs and other problems}
In case of gamebreaking bugs the tournament organizer may issue the following rules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skin not allowed in the tournament
	\item Champion not allowed in the tournament
	\item Item not allowed in the tournament
	\item Any other in game mechanic may also be forbidden if the bug produces an unfair advantage for any of the teams.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pause}
If you're having problems during the match, you can use the pause function of the game. The pause function may not be used during teamfights or to discuss the strategy for the game, you're only allowed in case anyone in the match has technical difficulties.
\\
If you suspect anyone paused the game to get an advantage out of it, please contact an admin immediately.

\section{Timetable}
Matches have to be played in the appropriate timeslots. We have set times where it's absolutely necessary to be present to play in the tournament. If a team is not able to play due to players missing, the match will be forfaited after a waiting time of 15 minutes after the scheduled match start.

\section{Punishments}
Violating the fair play rules or not respecting the decision of an admin or the tournament organizer may result in punishment.
\\
Depending on the gravity of the violation, the following punishments can be issued by an admin:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Warning
	\item Remake of a match
	\item Player being excluded from a tournament (in that case it's the teamcaptains responsability to find a substitute.)
	\item Match lost by forfeit
	\item Team being excluded from the League of Legends tournament
	\item Team being excluded from all tournaments (in this case, every player of the punished team may not compete in any other tournament and team)
	\item Player excluded from the event
	\item Team excluded from the event
\end{itemize}
Because we want the event to be a fun experience for everyone, we don't want to have to use the punishments, so please play fair, play nice, and have fun!
\\
If it's possible, always try to settle disputes directly in a nice manner.

\section{Most important}
And the most important rule: Have fun, play fair, make new friends.
