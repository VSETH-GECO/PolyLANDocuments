\section{Matches}

\subsection{POV demo}
Each player has to record a POV demo by typing record 'demoname' into the console.
The recording can be stopped by either closing the game or typing 'stop' into the console.\\
Demos have to be available for 6 hours after the end of the match.\\
Any POV demo can be requested by an Admin during this timespan.

\subsection{Mapveto}
Use \href{http://adminafk.geco.local/pages/veto.php}{adminafk.geco.local} to do the vetoes.\\
Choose a team at random by Steamchat /random, coinflip or rock, paper, scissors. The chosen team can then choose to be team A or B in the veto.\\
\\
We use the following modes for vetoing:\\

Best of 1:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Team A bans 2 maps
\item Team B bans 3 maps
\item Team A picks from the two remaining maps
\end{enumerate}

Best of 3:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Team A bans 1 map
\item Team B bans 1 map
\item Team A picks the map for game 1
\item Team B picks the map for game 2
\item Team B bans 1 map
\item Team A picks from the two remaining maps for game 3
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Server}
The server for the matches are assigned by the admins on \href{http://ebot.geco.local}{ebot.geco.local}.\\
When you connected to the server change to the map that won the veto by typing {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont 
!pick mapname} into the ingame chat.

\subsection{Kniferound}
Every map starts with a kniferound to decide who plays on which side.


\subsection{Pause}
\label{sec:pause}
Do not hesitate to use the pause function if you are experiencing any kind of problem or want to take a tactical timeout.\\
\\Technical pause: Write {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont 
!pause}  into the ingame chat at any time to pause the match after the next freezetime. If you can't fix a problem on your own contact an admin. Use {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont 
!unpause} to continue the match. You are not allowed to use these pauses to discuss things other than the technical problem. Generally you should avoid talking to your teammates during these pauses unless you are fixing the problem making the pause necessary in the first place.\\
\\Tactical pause: Vote with the ingame callvote menu "*press esc*/Callvote.../Call a tactical Timeout". Then your team has to accept it by pressing F1. You can only take two 60 seconds timeouts on each map.
