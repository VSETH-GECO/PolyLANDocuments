\subsection{Pause}
Do not hesitate to use the pause function if you are experiencing any kind of problem or want to take a tactical timeout. \\
\\Technical pause: Write {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont 
!pause}  into the ingame chat at any time to pause the match after the next freezetime. If you can't fix a problem on your own contact an admin. Use {\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont 
!unpause} to continue the match. You are not allowed to use these pauses to discuss things other than the technical problem. Generally you should avoid talking to your teammates during these pauses unless you are fixing the problem making the pause necessary in the first place.\\
