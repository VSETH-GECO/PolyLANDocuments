The team captain is the owner of the team, as indicated on our website.
He can only be changed before the tournament starts. After each match, the team captain of the losing team has to announce the result to the tournament organizer.


\section{Meeting}
At the start of every tournament there will be a meeting with all team captains and the tournament organizer. It is crucial to attend this meeting since a lot of important information for the respective tournament will be communicated at that meeting.


\section{Timetable}
Play matches as early as possible to avoid conflicts between tournaments.\\
Some tournaments will have a prioritized group phase. If you are part of such a tournament, you have to play the matches of this tournament during its phase.
You have to be ready to play your matches during the hours indicated on the timetable.\\
This applies to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the prioritized group phases
	\item the start of the mandatory attendance hours
	\item the start of the Playoff phase
	\item the start of the finals
\end{itemize}
Showing up late can lead to a game($>$5min) or even a match loss($>$15min).


\section{Seeding}
Tournament seedings will either be done at random or by the tournament organizer.\\
On some sign ups you will be asked for a estimate of your skill level in order to estimate the strength of your team.
Please provide an honest estimate this will make the tournament better for you and other participants.


\section{Tournament modes}
Most tournaments have a fixed tournament mode.
But the optimal group and bracket sizes will be chosen depending on the amount of teams participating at the event.\\
All tournaments will be held in one of the following modes:

\subsection{Double-Elimination}
In Double-Elim each team is eliminated when it lost 2 matches.\\
After losing the first match a team moves to the loser-bracket.\\
In some tournaments in the finals the team coming from the upper-bracket is given some kind of advantage.\\
e.g. head start of one match in a best of 3

\subsection{Round Robin}
Every team in a group plays against every other team from the same group.
The winner is defined according to a predefined set of criteria.
If no winner can be found with the first criteria the next one is considered and so on.\\
(e.g. Wins, RoundsWon, RoundsLost)

\subsection{Swiss}
The Swiss-system is similar to Round Robin. But matchups are always formed according to the previous losses and wins. Matching teams with similar success. After a certain number of rounds the winner is defined as in Round Robin.


\subsection{Groups/Playoffs}
First all teams are playing in Groups(see %Swiss/
Round Robin).\\
Then the top x teams of a Group move on to the Playoffs.\\
The Playoffs are held as Double-Elimination.


\section{Player Behavior}
\subsection{Cheating}
Any kind of cheating is strictly forbidden.\\
Abusing bugs on purpose, using any third-party software that gives you an unfair advantage and ghosting in any way are also considered cheating.

\subsection{Flaming}
Don't be toxic!\\
The event should be fun for everyone.


\subsection{Tournament organizer instructions}
Always follow the instructions of the tournament organizers.
